      Cricket is a bat-and-ball game that is played between two teams of
      <b>eleven players</b> on a field, at the centre of which is a 22-yard
      (20-metre; 66-foot) pitch with a wicket at each end, each comprising
      two bails (small sticks) balanced on three stumps. Two players from the
      batting team, the striker and nonstriker, stand in front of either
      wicket holding bats, while one player from the fielding team, the
      bowler, bowls the ball toward the striker's wicket from the opposite
      end of the pitch. <i>The striker's goal is to hit the bowled ball with
      the bat and then switch places with the nonstriker, with the batting
      team scoring one run for each of these swaps. Runs are also scored when
      the ball reaches the boundary of the field or when the ball is bowled
      illegally.</i>

  Traditionally, cricketers play in all-white kit, but in limited overs cricket, they wear club or team colours. In addition to the basic kit, some players wear protective gear to prevent injury caused by the ball, which is a hard, solid spheroid made of compressed leather with a slightly raised sewn seam enclosing a cork core layered with tightly wound string.
